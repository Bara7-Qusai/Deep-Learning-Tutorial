# Loss Functions for Different Types of Problems in Neural Networks

In neural networks, the choice of a loss function greatly depends on the type of problem being addressed. These problems can generally be categorized into three main types: linear regression or regression, classification, and multi-class classification. Below are the appropriate loss functions for each category:

## 1. Linear Regression or Regression

Loss functions in regression problems are used to measure the discrepancies between the predicted values and the actual continuous values. Here are some of the most commonly used loss functions in regression:

### A. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
This is one of the most widely used loss functions in regression, which measures the average squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values.

- **Equation**:
  \[
  L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2
  \]
  where:
  - \(N\) is the number of samples.
  - \(y_i\) is the actual value of sample \(i\).
  - \(\hat{y_i}\) is the predicted value of sample \(i\).

### B. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
This function measures the average absolute differences between the predicted values and the actual values, making it more robust to outliers compared to MSE.

- **Equation**:
  \[
  L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |y_i - \hat{y_i}|
  \]

### C. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
This is the square root of the MSE and is used to understand discrepancies in the same unit as the original measurements.

- **Equation**:
  \[
  L = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}
  \]

## 2. Classification

In classification problems, loss functions aim to measure the accuracy of the model’s classifications. These functions are widely used in binary classification problems.

### A. Binary Cross Entropy
This function is used when there are only two classes.

- **Equation**:
  \[
  L = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \log(\hat{y_i}) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y_i})]
  \]

## 3. Multi-Class Classification

When there are more than two classes, different loss functions are employed:

### A. Categorical Cross Entropy
This function is used when the true label for each sample is one-hot encoded.

- **Equation**:
  \[
  L = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{c=1}^{C} y_{ic} \log(\hat{y}_{ic})
  \]
  where:
  - \(C\) is the number of classes.
  - \(y_{ic}\) is an indicator (0 or 1) if the class label \(c\) is the correct classification for sample \(i\).
  - \(\hat{y}_{ic}\) is the predicted probability that sample \(i\) belongs to class \(c\).

### B. Sparse Categorical Cross Entropy
This function is used when the true labels are integers rather than one-hot encoded vectors.

- **Equation**:
  Similar to Categorical Cross Entropy, but dealing with integer labels.

## Summary

- **Regression**: Uses loss functions such as MSE and MAE.
- **Binary Classification**: Uses Binary Cross Entropy.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Uses Categorical Cross Entropy or Sparse Categorical Cross Entropy.

Choosing the appropriate loss function significantly helps in improving the model's performance by providing an accurate measure of errors during the training process.￼Enter
