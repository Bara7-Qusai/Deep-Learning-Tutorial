# Residual Networks and Skip Connections in Transformers

## Introduction

Residual networks (ResNets) and skip connections are essential components in deep learning architectures, particularly in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers. While ResNets were originally introduced to address the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks, skip connections have been adapted and utilized in transformer architectures for various reasons.

## Residual Networks (ResNets)

ResNets, introduced by He et al. in their paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition," revolutionized the field of computer vision by enabling the training of extremely deep neural networks. The key idea behind ResNets is the use of skip connections, also known as shortcut connections or identity mappings, which allow the network to learn residual functions instead of directly fitting the desired underlying mapping.

### Components of ResNets:

1. **Residual Blocks:** These blocks consist of a series of convolutional layers followed by activation functions (e.g., ReLU) and possibly normalization layers (e.g., batch normalization). The output of each block is combined with the input using a skip connection.

2. **Skip Connections:** These connections bypass one or more layers in the network by adding the input of a block to its output. This enables the network to learn residual mappings, making it easier to train deeper networks.

## Skip Connections in Transformers

In the context of transformers, skip connections serve a slightly different purpose compared to ResNets. While ResNets use skip connections to facilitate the training of deep networks, transformers leverage skip connections to improve information flow and enable better gradient propagation.

### Positional Embeddings:
In transformers, skip connections are often used in conjunction with positional embeddings. These embeddings provide information about the position of tokens in the input sequence and are added to the output of self-attention layers via skip connections.

### Residual Connections:
Similar to ResNets, residual connections in transformers allow the model to learn residual functions, enabling the propagation of gradients through multiple layers more effectively.

## Conclusion

Residual networks and skip connections play crucial roles in deep learning architectures, including both CNNs and transformers. While ResNets have been instrumental in enabling the training of deep convolutional networks, skip connections in transformers facilitate better information flow and gradient propagation, contributing to the success of transformer-based models in various natural language processing and computer vision tasks.

By understanding the principles behind residual networks and skip connections, practitioners can design more effective and efficient deep learning architectures for a wide range of applications.
